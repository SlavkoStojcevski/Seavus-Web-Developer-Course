CLONING THE PROJECT.

1. When you get the project from github, open terminal in the directory of first-project-init.
2. Type the command "npm intall" in the terminal (without the ""). 
3. This command will make package-lock.json reinstall all the packages that our project requires =)
4. You will notice a folder node_modules will be created.

Feel free to experiment with the code. Happy hacking :)

INSTALLING NODEMON.

1. If we install nodemon in our project and when executing with the command nodemon and get red error in console
    as "nodemon is not recongnised....." we should do the following.
2. Open "window/start" at the left bottom corner. Type "powershell". Open powershell AS administrator.
3. Type the following command : set-executionpolicy remotesigned and press enter.
4. A text will appear asking from us to write a letter. Type "A" (without "") and press enter =).
5. Restart/re-open terminal that is opened in vsCode.
